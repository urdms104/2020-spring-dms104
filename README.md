     - Note: you don't have to use the Word Doc.  You can copy-out the text however you want to do it, and work with your team to gather the information.  Remember: you *will not* be turning-in the Word doc.
  2. Turn the Worksheet into a team presentation<br>*Requirements*

     - Everyone in the team must appear and be heard in the video (at least a little) at some point
     - The audio and video must be *good enough* to be understood (a very low bar)
  3. Upload the ONE video file to the [DMS 104 Assignments folder](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22a8670baa-aaf1-4702-a0bd-ab8b00da179a%22) in Panopto, by EOD on Thursday, April 16
