## What You and Your Team Need to be Doing Now

### Modeling and Personas

1. EVERYONE: watch the [instruction video: **Modeling and Personas**, and **Modeling Workshop** (Panopto, 35 minutes)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0b5fa10e-7b81-4aa8-a84e-ab8800f5a48f)
   - [Chapter 10 and 11: Modeling and Personas (PDF)](18-modeling-and-personas/chapter10-11.pdf)
   - [Modeling Workshop (PDF)](18-modeling-and-personas/modeling-workshop.pdf)
2. EVERYONE: read **Chapter 10** (p201-226) and **Chapter 11** (p229-297)
   - Suggestion: for each chapter, start with the end, "Project Management..." and "Summary" to understand the scope...
   - Then dive in - understand the tools in chapter 10; understand the process in chapter 11
3. TEAM LEAD: setup a team meeting to coordinate...
   - Which tools to use from chapter 10
   - Who does what, when
   - When to get back together to review everything

## What's Coming Up Soon

- Thursday, March 26: Team/Professor Modeling Reviews
  - Each team needs to coordinate time with the professor to review their existing research and plans to model their data
  - The professor will contact each Team Lead to set it up

## Ongoing

- Keep/maintain an **individual DMS 104 work log**
  - Log meetings; who attended; and outcomes, who attended (who did not attend); and who did what
  - Focus on team members (not so much yourself)
  - Doesn't have to be an exhaustive/detailed account; just an overview of the important steps
  - Hold on to this information; you'll need it for our **peer assessment** after we complete Project 2

## Recent

- The **one-time full class live meeting**, Tuesday, March 24 at 12:30 PM EDT
  - [Recording available in Panopto](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=96e41844-de0b-4787-8639-ab8801211202)
