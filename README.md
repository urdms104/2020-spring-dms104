2. READ: **Chapter 10** (p201-226) and **Chapter 11** (p229-297)
   - Suggestion: for each chapter, start with the end, "Project Management..." and "Summary" to understand the scope...
   - Then dive in - understand the tools in chapter 10; understand the process in chapter 11
3. Setup a team meeting to coordinate...
   - Which tools to use from chapter 10
   - Who does what, when
   - When to get back together to review everything

## Ongoing

- Keep/maintain an **individual DMS 104 work log**
  - Log meetings; who attended; and outcomes, who attended (who did not attend); and who did what
  - Focus on team members (not so much yourself)
  - Doesn't have to be an exhaustive/detailed account; just an overview of the important steps
  - Hold on to this information; you'll need it for our **peer assessment** after we complete Project 2
