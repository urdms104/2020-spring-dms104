## What's Coming Up Soon

## Ongoing

- Keep/maintain an **individual DMS 104 work log**
  - Log meetings; who attended; and outcomes, who attended (who did not attend); and who did what
  - Focus on team members (not so much yourself)
  - Doesn't have to be an exhaustive/detailed account; just an overview of the important steps
  - Hold on to this information; you'll need it for our **peer assessment** after we complete Project 2
