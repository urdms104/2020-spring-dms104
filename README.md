## What You and Your Team Need to be Doing Now

If your team hasn't finished up creating **models** (including **personas**) and **context scenarios** and **requirements**, do that now because they are needed to complete Project 2...

*As of Thursday, April 2...*

- [ ] Watch the [Lecture Video: Project 2 - User & Domain Analysis (Panopto 11:45)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d94f0a18-0c45-4002-bc53-ab9100e4c2f1) (featuring ZÃ¶e)
  - You are required to watch this video in its entirety the same day. Counts as participation.
- [ ] Read **Chapter 13 - document part only** (p351 - 366, then skip to the end)
- [ ] [Project 2: User & Domain Analysis](project02-u&da/instructions.md) (due: Thursday, April 9)

## Ongoing

- Keep/maintain an **individual DMS 104 work log**
  - Log meetings; who attended; and outcomes, who attended (who did not attend); and who did what
  - Focus on team members (not so much yourself)
  - Doesn't have to be an exhaustive/detailed account; just an overview of the important steps
  - Hold on to this information; you'll need it for our **peer assessment** after we complete Project 2
