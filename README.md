## What You and Your Team Need to be Doing Now

Your team needs to be mostly focused on Project 2, but as you're waiting for other team members to finish their part...

*As of Tuesday, April 7...*

- [ ] Watch the [Lecture Video: Framework and Design Language Overview (Panopto 10:48)](https://rochester.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=59c2b38a-ab3b-48a7-bb04-ab950165fd28)
  - Accompanying slides: [Framework and Design Language Overview (PDF)](22-framework-and-design-language/framework-and-design-language-overview.pdf)
  - You are required to watch this video in its entirety the same day. Counts as participation.
- [ ] **READ Chapter 14, p377-403**

## Ongoing

- Keep/maintain an **individual DMS 104 work log**
  - Log meetings; who attended; and outcomes, who attended (who did not attend); and who did what
  - Focus on team members (not so much yourself)
  - Doesn't have to be an exhaustive/detailed account; just an overview of the important steps
  - Hold on to this information; you'll need it for our **peer assessment** after we complete Project 2
