# Project 2: User & Domain Analysis

*Due: Tuesday, April 2, 2019*

This assignment, Project 2, is worth 15% of your overall grade for this course.  For this assignment, you will work on a document as a team and initially, be graded equally.  Later we'll do a peer evaluation which may impact the distribution of the grade.

In summary: your city-team is required to create a document that summarizes the following data that you pulled together from the first half of the semester.  

- Stakeholder meeting (chapter 5)
- User Interviews and product research (chapters6-9)
- Modeling (chapter 10)
- Personas (chapter 11)
- Requirements and context scenarios (chapter 12)

The instructions for what goes into the User & Domain Analysis (U&DA) and how it is to be structured is explained in Chapter 13 of the book. 

## Sections

Listed below are the *typical* roles that have responsibility for the various sections.  However in the end, everyone is equally responsible for the quality of the document.

*Typically, this would be the responsibility of the Team Lead...*

- This entire document must be focused on **design issues and design concerns only**.  Marketing, engineering, or business issues and constraints may be mentioned in this document but only as it pertains to the design process.
- The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level documents: proper headers, footers, typeface, line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted documents, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade.
- Verbiage within the document must be clear and concise.  Spelling mistakes and poor grammar, or overly flowery or unnecessarily verbose paragraphs will be immediately suspect and most likely result in a lower grade.  

**The document must contain the sections as described in Chapter 13, clearly delineated with headings**

Here (below) are requirements and advice for each section:

### **Executive Summary**

*(Typical: Team Lead)*

- After the team writes everything else, create the Executive Summary; extract the most important and salient points from the other sections and write a relatively short set of concise paragraphs.
- Wrap-up with a general statement about your team’s feelings on the concerns and risks associated with the rest of design process.

### Introduction of the product idea and its project parameters

*(Typical: Team Lead)*

- Remind the reader of this document (the stakeholders) about the original product idea and what the inventor had in mind.
- Describe the early concerns (if any) and constraints you were given (usually from the stakeholders) before you started the design process.

### Research methods and rationale

*(Typical: any team member)*

- Describe the types of research you did. Explain what you did and why.
- Don’t forget to include in your list the stakeholder meeting and the focus group.  Then list everything else. 
- With each item in the list, explain how and why you thought that research type would be appropriate and useful for the product you were planning to design.
- In this section just describe the work you did – not the results.  Results go in the next section.

### Summary of research findings

*(Typical: whoever wrote the previous section)*

- In this section, summarize the results of every method described above.
- Do *not* include all the detail, e.g. leave out non-salient information from your research, i.e. information that didn't result in useful information.
- Use pull-quotes and any kind of special formatting to highlight the most interesting, impactful findings, however you see fit.
- Use the models you developed as necessary to tell a narrative story; include graphs, charts, pictures as needed to explain the general issues and patterns.
- Remember: do not mix product features or design aspects in here (or anywhere in this document for that matter! )
  - Common mistake: putting information about the finished product in the U&DA.  You haven’t designed the product yet so don’t talk about any aspect of its design or the products features anywhere in this document.  
  - For example, don't say "app" or "touch screen" ...things like that.  Just refer to "the product" or "the interface."

### Personas

*(Typical: any team member)*

- Start with an introduction that describes the persona development process you used. (Information like this comes right out of the book. Chapter 11.)
- *Introduce each pe*rsona, one at a time.  Provide all the detail – the complete persona (usually one per page).  
- Make sure to include a list of general user motivations and goals that each persona has WITHOUT talking about the product you’re designing.  (Of course, the goals will eventually relate to the product, but don’t say anything about the product here.)
- Make sure to include a list of user goals for *each* persona.


### Context Scenarios and Requirements

*(Typical: IxD)*

- List your context scenarios and descriptions and relate each scenario to one or more personas.
  - Remember: context scenarios are optimistic - future-state predictions that satisfy the persona’s motivations and goals.
- Relate the list of requirements to the context scenarios and/or all the research, models and personas as appropriate for your particular product.
- Be sure to specify: data needs (nouns) and functional needs (verbs)

### Experience Attributes

*(Typical: VisD and ID)*

- List and describe each experience attribute and be sure to relate each to where or why each one exists
  - For example, was it a requirement of a stakeholder; did people in your focus group say something about it?
- Describe any other requirements: product qualities; constraints - things you know that the product (when designed) must account for

### Colophon

*(Typical: Team Lead)*

- The last page of the document needs to list who worked on the design team, their roles, and a short description of their contribution to this U&DA document.
- Note: this is not the peer-evaluation.  That'll happen separately, in a private way.

## Advice
This cannot be said enough: the book is a template for everything we’re doing in this course. In many cases, you can simply look in the book to figure out how to write and format your document.  Steal shamelessly!  Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.

The User & Domain Analysis is explained in detail in Chapter 13.  You can simply follow the instructions to build your own U&DA.  However, some sections in the book assume you did things differently than we’re doing in DMS 104.  For example, you didn’t do dozens of interviews therefore you don’t have to describe the process for paring down interviews into personas.  Most of you just did 1:1 conversions: interview --> user role --> persona.  But other than that, most of what you need to do is spelled out with lots of examples and descriptions.

## Submission in Blackboard

*One team member* (typically the Team Lead) needs to turn-in the document in Blackboard.

Required: submit a **Microsoft Word** document (not Google Doc; not Apple Pages)

In our DMS 104 section, look in the Assignments area for "**Project 2: User & Domain Analysis**"
