# Checkpoint 2: Team Role Presentation
*Due dates:*

* Monday, January 20, by end-of-day: PowerPoint file submitted in Blackboard
* Tuesday, January 21, in-class presentation

## Read Up

- [ ] Read Chapter 2: Assembling the Team (p15-32)
  - Focus on the five team roles (p16-25) 
  - NOTE: the "close collaborators" and "other product team members" will be on the midterm exam ...so read-up about them and take book-notes about them too
  - Choose your own *initial* design team role
    - IxDG
    - IxDS
    - VisD
    - ID
    - Team Lead
  - NOTE: you will *not* necessarily get the role you choose for yourself, but it's a good way to introduce yourself to the rest of the class

## Prepare a Presentation

- Prepare a two-minute, one slide presentation about the role you picked for yourself: *why you'd be a good one*
- Be sure to follow the [Presentation Rules (PDF)](../01-introduction/presentation-rules.pdf)

- [ ] Upload your presentation file to **Checkpoint 1: Team Role Presentation** in our DMS 104 section of Blackboard
  - Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT) file only - *not* Google Slides; *not* Apple Keynote; *not* PDF
  - Overall file size must be less than 1 MB
  - Must be submitted in Blackboard before end-of-day (midnight-ish?) on Monday, January 20

- [ ] Then be prepared to deliver your two-minute presentation in-class on Tuesday, January 21.  
  - The professor will take your file from Blackboard and show it on the screen while you're presenting; you don't have to do anything about that on Tuesday (just make sure you turn-in your PPT file in Blackboard on-time on Monday)
  - Note: it will be a hectic, rapid-fire (and somewhat messy) class starting at exactly 12:30 PM; if you are called-up to present and you're not there and/or ready to go, you'll be skipped and you'll receive a zero for this part of the assignment (so don't be late!)
  - Also note: the class will be video recorded and available online so you guys can refer to these presentations later
