# Checkpoint 3: Project Ideation

This page describes your homework to prepare for the actual checkpoint that'll be on **Tuesday, January 28**.  Don't wait too late to get started.  You need to **work as a team** on this!

## Team Suggestions

When in doubt about who's who, check our master list of [DMS 104 City Teams (Google Sheet)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UbdBF9IbIszRgiBGJvKIZuRk87naHoRm23v-MqI_drE/edit#gid=0)

NOTE: typically it's the **Team Lead** that needs to corral the rest of the team on this.  Suggestions:

- Use Slack. The **Team Lead** should create a *private* channel and invite the other members in to it.
  - You don't have to use Slack, but it's an industry standard, and it's there for your use
  - Note: the professor (or anyone else) cannot see your private channel!  It's totally up to you, and when you're in there you can talk about whatever you want.
- The **Team Lead** needs to know everyone's class schedule and other commitments so they can schedule get-togethers around them.
- The **Team Lead** should know about good areas to meet and break-out rooms (like in iZone), and how to schedule them
- The **Team Lead** needs to be good at time-keeping and note-taking to keep everyone moving forward together and on-time (and never leave things to the last minute! ...shit happens)

And everyone else, remember this: the Team Lead is *not* the boss of you!  Think of them more like an administrator or facilitator that helps you get things done as a team.

## Ideation

"Ideation" is the process of generating, developing and communicating new ideas.  For DMS 104, you're going to step-out of your team role as designer, and temporarily think of yourself as an entrepreneur, working in a team of entrepreneurs.

Note: although you have *design team roles*, forget about that for now! Only the Team Lead has specific responsibilities at this point.  For this part of the process, everyone, including the Team Lead, is an equal partner here.

- [ ] Each team needs to come to Tuesday's meeting prepared with **at least one design project idea** (more than one is better)
- [ ] The design project idea(s) must **follow the criteria** listed in the section below

## Criteria

Your team needs to come up with an idea that will need to be approved by the professor ...which will happen later.  Then you will work with your team on **designing** the idea over the rest of the semester.

*Note: "designing" does not mean engineering, coding, developing, nor building anything.  Also, don't be confused with pricing, selling, nor anything else having to do with marketing.*

You are DESIGNERS, meaning you will focus on the following this semester:
- its visual style (the VisD)
- its physical look & feel (the ID)
- its interface and interoperability (the IxDG and IxDS)

Also note: even if you follow all the criteria listed below, your idea might not be appropriate for DMS 104 anyway.  Only the professor knows which ideas will work in DMS 104. Don't get too passionate about any one idea!  You might end-up disappointed.

***Your team's idea(s):*** 

- [ ] Must have a physical component
  - Things the user will touch, see, and interact with
  - Things to design will include: color, weight, size/shape, durability, power constraints, materials to be used in manufacturing ...stuff like that
  - Note: you don't have to decide all those things at this point ...that's what you'll be working on all semester long!
  - Note: the idea cannot be just software or a website; it has to have a *unique* physical presence (which also means you can't just say it'll be used on a smart phone or tablet ...those things have already been designed!)
  
- [ ] Must have a computer/digital interface (remember this course is in the DIGITAL Media Studies program  - digital means computerized)
  - The interface does not necessarily mean it has to have a screen; e.g. touch-sensitive surfaces; motion detectors ...there are lots of choices!
  - Again, you don't have to pick those things at this point!  Just know, those are decisions you'll need to make later, for whatever you design. 
  
- [ ] Must be interactive â€“ changeable based on situations/conditions
  - The project idea must have multiple "states", meaning it must change in some way based on user input
  - E.g. digital tea pot: on, off, what kind of tea? how much to make (quantity)? ...stuff like that (not just on/off)
  
- [ ] Must be reasonably feasible
  - Even though we won't necessarily build your idea this semester, it must be something that *could* be built; i.e. no magic; the idea must be feasible using technology that exists today
  - Must be potentially economically feasible; i.e. something that *could* support a viable business plan (even though we won't be developing a business model - that's marketing's job); i.e. no spaceships! ...yet

## Presentation

*Due: Tuesday, January 28* <s>(does not need to be turned-in on Blackboard)</s> ...change!  See the instructions for turning-in this assignment at the bottom.

Your team must **put together a few slides** and be prepared to deliver a **FIVE MINUTE** presentation about your team's idea(s) to the class

- Who speaks or how exactly the presentation is delivered doesn't matter so long as the presentation follows the [presentation rules (PDF)](../01-introduction/presentation-rules.pdf) ...see Slide #3
- Your team will be graded together as a group
- The grade will not be focused on the greatness of the idea, rather it's viability for DMS 104 (pass/fail), and your ability to present the idea on Tuesday (based on the presentation rubric)
- Note: this will be a "checkpoint" assignment ...i.e. it's low stakes, but still graded

*HINT: whoever shows your team's slides should practice connecting to the projector in Gavett 301 BEFORE presentation day.  Any technical problems are your fault!*

### Presentation Guidelines

You don't have to get fancy here or create any new graphics (although that'd be okay if you do).  The goal of this presentation is to simply get your idea(s) across so the class and professor understand what you plan to design this semester.

- [ ] Your idea(s) needs to have a short name; e.g. "digital tea pot"
- [ ] You need to present a short description (a few words) that describes its value or novelty; e.g. "makes all kinds of tea perfectly and easily" ...something like that
- [ ] Also describe (in a few short bullets)...
  - The hardware (generally) and/or it's physical presentation
  - The human interface; what kind(s) and how it'll be used
  - The interactivity (what changes state based on what condition; e.g. on, off, what kind of tea? how much to make, et cetera)

...above all, remember you're NOT designing the idea here!  (That's what we'll do for the rest of the semester.) You're just describing an idea on one or two slides, delivered in five minutes or so.

## Presentation Turn-in

(NEW!) The presentation file needs to be turned-in.

- [ ] ONE team member (typically the Team Lead) needs to make a submission in Blackboard for this assignment so the entire team can be graded. In Blackboard, in the "Checkpoint turn-in" section you'll find **Checkpoint 3: Project Ideation**.  There, ONE TEAM MEMBER needs to upload the presentation file that was used in the Tuesday, January 28 class.

NOTE: after the first person in any team makes a submission for this assignment, it's locked! So make sure everyone on the team knows who's supposed to upload the file. Everyone else doesn't need to do anything.
