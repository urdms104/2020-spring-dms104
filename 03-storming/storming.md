# Homework: Team Forming & Storming
This is what you need to do before we meet again on **Thursday, January 23**.  There's nothing for you to turn-in but you need to be prepared for the activities we do onThursday.

## Create a List

- [ ] **Review** the Slack #chatter channel intros (that was Checkpoint 1) and the slides and your notes from Tuesday's Team Role Presentation (that was Checkpoint #2)

  - Checkpoint 1: [https://app.slack.com/client/TS485SS6R/CS3PUNWFN](https://app.slack.com/client/TS485SS6R/CS3PUNWFN)
  - Checkpoint 2: [http://docs.dms104.org/02-team-intro-presentations/everyones-presentations.pdf](http://docs.dms104.org/02-team-intro-presentations/everyones-presentations.pdf) (large file - 100 MB!)

  **Make a list of people** you need to complete your own *design* team. (You know: the five design team roles from Chapter 2!)  Note: it's okay to start with a long list. The next steps we take will pare-down your list quite a lot.

  BTW, don't get discouraged if most or all your choices don't end-up being on your team.  The point of all this is to go through the steps and *try* to build a solid team, but we're limited by what we have each semester.

## Learn about Tuckman's Stages of Group Development

- [ ] **Read this Wikipedia article** about how teams are formed and what to expect (just focus on the first part about "Forming", "Storming", "Norming", and "Performing").

  - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development)

  For your reference, the stage we're in is: FORMING, moving into STORMING on Thursday

## Get Your Myers-Briggs Personality Type

- [ ] Do you know your Myers-Briggs personality type?  If not, go to this website and take the short test.
  - [https://www.16personalities.com](https://www.16personalities.com)

  At the end of it, take note of your four-letter personality type and understand about what it says about you.  Hopefully, it's accurate.  When we get together on Thursday (January 23) you'll need to remember your personality type.

## Learn How to Create a Balanced Team

- [ ] Next, **read this article** about using your personality type to create balanced teams.
  - [https://www.resourceumc.org/en/content/how-to-use-personality-tests-to-create-balanced-teams](https://www.resourceumc.org/en/content/how-to-use-personality-tests-to-create-balanced-teams)

  In a nutshell: the better you can get a balance of **Visionaries**, **Idealists**, **Conductors**, and **Troubleshooters** in one team, the better.

Finally, just for fun take a look at **your version of hell** based on your Myers-Briggs personality type.
