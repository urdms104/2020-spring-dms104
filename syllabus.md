# Course Syllabus: DMS 104 - Design in the Digital Age

Designing digital products and services requires a process of "Interaction Design" which is a wholly new discipline that moves beyond previous fads of simply making digital things that look like physical world objects. Since there is no known formula for creating great UI/UX we will explore the need to consider interactivity as a design process, moving from initial ethnographic research through ideation and design, and the many steps that lead to final delivery and presentation. Mastery of this process will prepare DMS students to undertake their senior capstone project as well as effectively develop other creative and entrepreneurial ideas/ventures.

In addition to the book, more information required to pass the course comes from the lectures so attendance is mandatory.

**Important:** Because attendence is not graded each student is on thier honor to go to all the lectures. If a student is unable to attend a lecture, it is the student's responsibility to get the information missed from another student. (The TA and the professor will not re-teach a lecture.)

Students' inability to answer exam questions, complete lab assignments, or complete projects because of a missed lecture is not a valid excuse.

### Presentation Software

Students are required to create and present information in-class on a regular basis using slides and a projector.

## Grading

For each assignment, a grading rubric will be provided. Rubrics will inform students how assignments are evaluated. In the interest of fairness, extra credit and make-up work is not offered.

### Participation

The design of this course follows a "flipped" structure that requires students to learn basic concepts as assigned outside the classroom, and participate in workshops and group activities during the classroom sessions. Although attendance is not graded it is required for success in the course.

Outside of the classroom sessions, students need to: read/study assigned sections of the book; coordinate with other students to work on assignments; and be ever vigilant looking for and responding to announcements from the professor.

### Due Dates

For each assignment and project, the **due date** is shown near the top of its instruction sheet. To avoid a zero grade, each must be turned-in via Blackboard on or before its due date.

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be graded unless a prior arrangement has been made with the TA or the professor for an **extension by one or two days**. Extensions will only be granted two or three times, maximum, per semester, at the discretion of the TA or professor.

The grade for assignments not turned-in on time with no prior arrangement for an extension will be zero.

## Academic Honesty

Violation of the College's Honesty Policy is a serious violation of the trust upon which our academic community depends. A common form of academic dishonesty is plagiarism: the representation of another person's work as one's own, or the attempt "to blur the line between one's own ideas or words and those borrowed from another source." ([Council of Writing Program Administrators, January 2003,](http://wpacouncil.org/node/9)). In cases where plagiarism is evident, the University's rules governing academic dishonesty will be followed. As required by College policy, all instances of plagiarism are reported to the College Board of Academic Honesty. For the complete College honesty policy, see: [www.rochester.edu/college/honesty](http://www.rochester.edu/college/honesty)
