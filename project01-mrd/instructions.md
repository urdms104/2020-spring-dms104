# Project 1: Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)

*Due: Tuesday, February 4, 2020*

This assignment, Project 1, is worth 5% of your overall grade for this course.  For this assignment, you will work as a team to submit a document in Blackboard.  It gets one grade that gets shared equally among all members in the team.  Later, I'll ask everyone to submit a private message for a peer evaluation.  If need be, I'll investigate concerns that arise out of the peer evaluations and re-distribute the grade-points accordingly.

The requirements for what goes into the *Marketing Requirements Document* (MRD) is explained in Chapter 3 of the book.  Focus on the MRD and "Determining Your Project's Parameters" part, not the *Project Plan* part.  

## Instructions

- [ ] Write the Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)
  
  - The structure and content of the MRD must answer the questions (the sections) to the best of your ability as described in Chapter 3 of the book (pages 35-39)
  - Depending on the project idea you're working with, some of the sections will be easier to answer than others, and some might make no sense.  Regardless, you must address all the sections and say *something* for each.
  - Remember: the document is *not* a sales brochure for the product.  It is a document that works as "marching orders" for the design team (you guys).
  - Also, remember: you have not designed the product yet so do *not* describe the product in detail!  Instead, describe what it's supposed to do, address the ambiguities at this point (there should be many) and what your design challenge will be.

# Hints & Tips

The following items are suggestions, but really each team can proceed however they want to complete this assignment.

- The **Team Lead** should create a shared document (Google Docs seems to work very well for this purpose) and fill it out with the usual formal document parts and a basic outline.

- Include the usual document parts like: a title with a date â€¦stuff like that.  *Note: You will be graded on fundamental document formatting and presentation qualities, i.e. make it look nice and professional!*
- Include a list everyone on the team and their role
- The document should start with the working title of the project idea and a general description of what you believe the stakeholders have in mind.   

- Then the rest of the document should follow the outline provided from the headings in the book, in the section: "Determining Your Project's Parameters."  Just write what you think the stakeholders wants to hear.  DO NOT use marketing *fluff words*.  Be specific in terms of the design process. 

- Suggestion for the **Team Lead**: set up the document and assign various parts to the team members.  In this case, it doesn't matter who does what.  You're all getting graded together as one.  


# Submissions in Blackboard

For the document: Blackboard has a group feature that allows anyone in a group to make a submission on the behalf of the group. Be careful!  You should decide in advance who's going to make the submission so there's no confusion.  (Typically, the Team Lead)

If you submit a link to a Google Doc, be sure to invite the professor as a Viewer.

- The deadline is **Tuesday, February 4**
