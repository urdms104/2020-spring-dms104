# DMS 104: Final Project

*Due: Friday, May 10, 2020 (end of exams week)*

This assignment brings together your city-team's **Design Vision** and **Form & Behavior Specification (F&BS)** into one document.

For this assignment, you will work as a team.  Specific roles and responsibilities for who writes which parts should be understood by now, and clear instructions and management should be provided by the team lead.

## Part 1: Design Vision

Think of the *Design Vision* as **your book of rules** that you’ll use for the F&BS in Part 2.  

In our book, *Design for the Digital Age*, the Design Vision is based on the instruction from these chapters:  

- Interaction Framework (Chapters 15, 16)
- Design Language (Chapters 17, 18)

Also note, everyone in the team must deliver at least part of the Design Vision for which they'll be graded.  

### Document Structure

NOTE: the following sections are described in detail in Chapter 19, in the book, starting with *Crafting the Story* on page 517.  You can follow what's described in those pages keeping in mind: you are working on a document, not a presentation, and you are working on a much smaller project and you don't have to go into as much detail as they do in the book. 

- [ ] (Team Lead) The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level work: readable typography, proper line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted pages, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade. 
- [ ] (Team Lead) **The document *should* contain the** sections shown below, clearly delineated with the following headings.
  - The team roles listed there are suggestions only *(Note: the best teams share so much of the work load that it's sometimes hard to tell who did what ...that would be a good thing.)*
  - You are free to change or re-interpret these sections as you see fit, based on the specifics of the information you need to document for your particular product idea.

#### Sections

- [ ] **Project Summary and Expectations** (team lead)
  - This is where you re-introduce your product and what it will do.  Don't re-tell everything.  Keep it short.
  - Here you can bring up ongoing concerns and issues (if any) that impact the design.
- [ ] **Key Personas and Requirements** (team lead)
  - This is a short re-statement of the personas and requirements you created from the U&DA
  - Do *not* just copy and paste all your personas and requirements from the U&DA; include only things from the U&DA that strongly influenced the Design Vision.
- [ ] **Big Ideas and Major Anatomy**, a.k.a. the *Interaction Framework* (IxDG and IxDS)
  - Focus on the interaction framework chosen (typical choices were listed in Chapter 15) and why. 
  - List data objects and functional needs (remember: nouns and verbs) and highlight where they come into play in the framework. This comes mostly from the U&DA but the Interactive Designer(s) need to tie it together with their framework choices.
  - Introduce the Interaction Design Anatomy.  Think of this section as wire frame interface(s) with general descriptions of each major part.
    - Remember to use *unrealistic* imagery. Wireframes, sketches, et cetera. You are writing rules for design, not the actual design itself.
- [ ] **Scenario Storyboards** (IxDG and IxDS)
  - This is, in effect, a visual and descriptive walk-through of the "play" 
  - Each walk-through is referred to as a "key path" - make sure you use the correct terminology as you write-up the scenario storyboards.  (Google: *storyboards* if you're unfamiliar with that term)
- [ ] **How the Design Serves Persona Needs** (VisD and/or ID)
  - Make sure you tie the key paths back to each persona need.  Be specific, referring to the exact language used in the U&DA as much as possible.
- [ ] **Design Language**(s) (VisD and/or ID)
  - Introduce the Form Factor design requirements. (This would come from the **Industrial Designer**.)
  - This section lists the design choices for the interface and physical component(s) as defined by the both the **Visual Designer** and **Industrial Designer**.  (Remember the example documents from *First Niagara Bank*.)
  - Remember: the design language is not the actual design of the product.  You can use example parts of the product in your design language but only where necessary so you can have something to show. Generally, it's better to simply list fonts, colors, shapes, et cetera AND (most importantly) what from the U&DA drove those decisions.



## Part 2: Form & Behavior Specification

The F&BS is a document that describes every interaction, and every visual and physical (industrial) aspect of the product.  It needs to have enough specific information so engineers could use it to build a working prototype.  *(Note: this, in effect, would be what you will do as part of your DMS Capstone Project.)*

In our book, *Design for the Digital Age*, the F&BS is based on the instruction from these chapters:  

- Principles and Patterns (Chapter 21)
- Process and Practices (Chapter 22)

Also note, everyone in the team must deliver at least part of the F&BS for which they'll be graded.  

### Requirements

The recommended document structure for what is supposed to be in a Form and Behavior Specification is the book (chapter 24), however, keep in mind that the book is written for large companies with lots of professional designers working full-time.  Also, you have to decide what makes sense for  *your* product design - not all the same type of tools makes sense for all products.  So for DMS 104 students: do the best you can...

- [ ] Render realistic drawings
- [ ] Create charts
- [ ] Use arrows on diagrams that explain things
- [ ] Provide explanations in short paragraphs or tables with steps and/or descriptions of things

See chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.  How exactly your team does that that, is up to you.  (Note: the professor will naturally tend to give higher grades to good looking, well rendered diagrams and illustrations, so do try!)

### Document Structure

The structure of the F&BS document will be based on the particulars of your product - so it'll be different for every city-team.  However, the document still needs to uphold standards:

- [ ] **Introduction page:** a general (short – about one paragraph) introduction and perhaps an image (rendering) of the product
- [ ] There needs to be clear and **appropriately named section headers** that describe each section of the document
  - Hint: never write long paragraphs of text or many paragraphs one after another in any professional report.  Break up short concise paragraphs with lots of headings and sub-headings that describe them.


- [ ] The document must follow **normal formatting practices** for college-level documents: headers, footers, typeface, line spacing, et cetera.  Poorly formatted documents, spelling mistakes, or anything that makes the document difficult to read will result in a reduced grade.

### Content Details

Every aspect of your team’s product design must be defined and presented in the the *F&BS.* It is your final deliverable for DMS 104.  

The Team Lead needs work with the rest of the team to figure-out the best way to structure the document and make sure there are full descriptions of your product in terms of:

- Its interface - every interaction (from the IxD)
- Its visual properties (from the VisD)
- Its physical properties (from the ID)

(Again, see chapter 24 for lots of examples of various types of ways to represent product designs.)

- [ ] (*Everyone's responsibility...*) Every aspect of each part of the final design must be clearly labeled and explained, not only in its function, but the rationale for why it exists.  (Note: if the professor thinks you're just making-up things, you'll lose points. Be sure to be specific regarding each design attribute.)

### Citations

- [ ] As much as possible, **tie every aspect** back to:

  - The Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)
  - The User & Domain Analysis (U&DA)
  - The Design Vision

  ...by making **citations to the specific document, section, page and/or paragraph**, throughout the Form and Behavior Specification. 

*Note: you do not have to use formal citations; just make it clear where F&BS decisions are coming from. You can use inline citations, references, footnotes, whatever makes sense.*

### Advice

This cannot be said enough: the book is a template for everything we’re doing in this course. In many cases, you can simply look in the book to figure out how to write and format your presentation.  Steal shamelessly!  Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.

### Colophon

- [ ] The last page of the document needs to list who worked on the design team, their roles, and a short description of their contribution to this document.

## Submission in Blackboard

*One team member* (typically the Team Lead) needs to turn-in the document in Blackboard.

Required: submit a **Microsoft Word** document (not Google Doc; not Apple Pages; not PDF)
