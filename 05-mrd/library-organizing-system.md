# Marketing Requirements Document (MRD) "Library Organizing System"

*App and device to help students find places to work, study, and find each other*

The *Library Organizing System* (working title) is an integrated software solution with a physical device placed in all designated study areas that allows students to better utilize break-out rooms, study areas, and carrels on the university campus.  

The Library Organizing System would provide students the following capabilities:

- See exactly what study areas are available now and in the near future, and where they are
- See how to navigate from their current location to any study area
- Book a study area for future use
- Notify/invite and give directions to other students to meet in a study area that they currently occupy or have booked for later

The integrated Library Organizing System will include:

- Web-based and native app interfaces with the following features:
  - Booking: view; create; update; cancel
  - Communication: student-to-student (invitations)
  - Navigation: turn-by-turn to any study area
- A physical unit with the following features
  - Card-reader (mag stripe) and/or contactless (NFC) reader for smart phones
  - Touch panel and display
  - Motion detector

## Revenue or Cost Focus

Although the Library Organizing System is for use in non-profit university settings, the focus on "cost reduction" is a close analogy.  Students, who are time-challenged due to their course load and busy extra-curricular activities would get the benefit from a system that reduces the amount of time wandering around libraries looking for places to study and the location of their study partners. 

The assumption is that students would be more productive if they could go directly to a study area and begin work sooner.

## Desire to Innovate

The central feature of the Library Organizing System would **not** be unique.  The existing product **Joan** (https://getjoan.com/) that targets organizations with a large number of meeting rooms contains many of the booking and resource utilization features for which the Library Organizing System may "borrow."  

However that and other similar products do not address the unique needs of the university environment such as the following that would require new innovation:

- Integrated directions (navigation) to study areas including a dynamic "find me" feature to allow students to find each other
- Informational usage policies to ensure study areas are not overcrowded, nor do they become noisy in areas designated for quiet study
- Compliance (and penalties?) for failure to use booked resources as planned
- Auto-usage features to determine when a study area is *not* being used, or becomes free early (regardless of scheduled booking)
- "TA mode" for teaching assistants to set-up office hours

## Length of Time Horizon

Targeting a beta test over the summer, the stakeholders of the Library Organizing System have established the summer of 2019 as the target for launch.  

The set-back schedule for the design, development, manufacturing and delivery of the Library Organizing System is as follows: 

- Design Process: February through the end of April 2019
- Prototype development and manufacturing: May 2019
- Delivery of the first working set of products: June 2019

## Understanding of the Problem

University's provide a large number of study areas, many of which go unused because students need to physically check each one to see if they're in-use, and then figure out if they are part of some booking system for which they may or may not know how to use.  That, combined with the need to collaborate with other students compounds the confusion and increases the amount of lost time wandering around trying to locate each other.

**The challenge will be for the design team** to create a friction-free interface to the Library Organizing System that allows students to maximize the available study resources without the burden of a hard-to-use, hard-to-learn system. 

## Willingness to Invest

The target market of the Library Organizing System is universities like the University of Rochester that can afford to provide high-end support to its student population.  As such, the design, including form-factors and technology capabilities should "spare no expense" to make a product that looks and feels comfortable to use and unobtrusive in its design.

## Risk Factors

The concept of "friction free" usage is the greatest concern.  It's understood that students are overwhelmed by their existing workload, plus the never-ending parade of "tools" at their disposal that are supposed to make their college experience easier.  The Library Organizing System would be yet-another in that parade, therefore it's at greatest risk for being ignored if not designed correctly.

Students must view the Library Organizing System as an immediate benefit without a substantial (or any) learning curve.
