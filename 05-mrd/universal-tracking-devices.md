# Marketing Requirements Document (MRD) "Universal Tracking Devices"

*Suite of devices to find wide array of lost things*

The *Universal Tracking Devices* product (working title) is an integrated hardware and software solution that users can attach to things they own to be able to find them in case they are lost.  Users will purchase and attach physical devices, ranging from stickers to small transceivers, to their property and then register each item with their account.

The types and capabilities of each physical device will range from very small, with limited function, to very complex with greater range and capabilities.  Tracking and management of the users' devices will be done through a web-application or native smart phone apps.

Device capabilities will vary.  Some will include:

- Wi-fi, and/or Bluetooth, and/or cellular connectivity
- Accelerometer to track it's movement
- Built-in speakers to play alerts or ultrasound signals
- A camera to transmit its current surroundings to the user
- Self-contained power source

...and other capabilities as determined by user research.

Another feature to extend the capabilities of the devices: a smartphone attachment with its own sensor to help triangulate and direct the user toward the lost item.

Possible items users may attach devices to:

- Smartphones, tablets, computers, and other personal devices
- Books, backpacks, and other personal effects
- Pets (with collars)
- Cars, bikes, scooters

## Revenue or Cost Focus

There are two ways to look at the business value of the Universal Tracking Devices product: both as a revenue generator, or as a cost reduction solution.

The product itself is an extensible system with a low cost of entry that will generate revenue as the user develops trust and dependence on the system, thereby purchasing more and more devices.  

The product may also be help reduce costs when purchased by an organization that trusts its employees with company equipment that could be lost or stolen, thereby reducing shrinkage of its property.  The product can also be considered a productivity enhancement by enabling employees to spend less time looking for misplaced items.

## Desire to Innovate

The workflow and concepts for some of the Universal Tracking Devices features are similar to existing solutions built-in to Apple products (e.g. Find My iPhone) and other products on the market.  However there is no unified system on the market today that can conceivably find *any* item.  

The greatest feature of the Universal Tracking Devices integrated solution is that it will work with a wide array of units with a large set of options that the user can mix and match depending on their concern for loss of property, and price sensitivity.  

The engineers working on the Universal Tracking Devices are committed to pull-off new efficiencies in power management and range to achieve virtually 100% effectivity, however the depth and breadth of the system will require significant new **design** innovations to work with such a wide array of items, and it must provide friction-free setup and effortless operation no matter how many items the user tracks.

## Length of Time Horizon

Targeting a beta test over the summer, the stakeholders of the Universal Tracking Devices system have established the summer of 2019 as the target for launch.  

The set-back schedule for the design, development, manufacturing and delivery of the Universal Tracking Devices is as follows: 

- Design Process: February through the end of April 2019
- Prototype development and manufacturing: May 2019
- Delivery of the first working set of products: June 2019

| Delivery of final design and presentation         | Late April 2019          |

## Understanding of the Problem

Price sensitivity to a solution that finds lost items is the concern of the marketing department.  Marketing, working with manufacturing will try to keep the cost of the attachable devices so low that users would attach them to virtually everything they own.  Accordingly, engineering is tasked with the goal of making the devices exceed expectations in terms of their effectivity.  That leaves the **design of the following items critical to the success** of the product:

- The form factors and capabilities of each attachable device (industrial design)
- The interface to manage the users' items (visual and interactive design)
- The workflow to use the interface to find lost items (interactive design) 

## Willingness to Invest

At first, the target market of Universal Tracking Devices product will be high-end users with disposable income because, assumptively, they own a lot of things that cost a lot.  As such, the design, including form-factors and technology capabilities should "spare no expense" to make a product that looks and feels comfortable to use and unobtrusive in its design.

## Risk Factors

The concept of "friction free" usage is the greatest concern.  Without the Universal Tracking Devices system, people are content with simply *being responsible* for their own items, and don't need to overlay a needlessly complex and hard-to-use system that may or may not work when they need it.  The concern is that users will not change their behavior when it comes to managing their own property.

When an item is lost, the system needs to "just work" without making the user think, else the product may never get past the barrier of their current behavior.
